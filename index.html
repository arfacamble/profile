        <h2>I am training to be a programmer</h2>
        <p>I am attending le Wagon in order to achieve this</p>
        <p>This button is functional but not useful, designed but certainly not attractive</p>
        <a href="https://emojipedia.org/pile-of-poo/" target="_blank" class='btn'>button</a>
        <p>I think I'm going to prefer the back-end stuff, leave the design to others.</p>

        <h2>I used to be a teacher</h2>
        <p>What could be more important than education? Throughout the world, in all systemic societal issues, we find that some form of education is an integral part of any long term solution.</p>
        <p>I trained at the University of Kingston. I love the maths. I worked at Morpeth School in Bethnal Green. I have subsequently worked as a medium term supply teacher at Sacred Heart (Hammersmith) and St Helen's (Northwood)</p>
        <p>I have also trained with the Philosophy Foundation to facilitate sessions with primary school age children.</p>
        <p>I thought it might be fun to have multiple paragraphs in this div/box/card</p>
